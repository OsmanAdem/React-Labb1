            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                Our coffee shop was founded in 2010 by two friends who shared a
                passion for coffee and a desire to create a community gathering
                place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, we have grown and expanded our menu to include a
                variety of beverages and food options, but our commitment to
                quality and community remains the same.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>
                We are a team of dedicated coffee enthusiasts who love what we
                do. From our baristas to our bakers, we take pride in every cup
                of coffee and every pastry we serve.
